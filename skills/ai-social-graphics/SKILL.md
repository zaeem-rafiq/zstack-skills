# AI Social Graphics

This skill creates platform-optimized graphics for social media. Not generic images that happen to be the right size — graphics engineered for each platform's specific algorithm, user behavior, and visual language.

**Use this skill when:** You need graphics for specific social platforms or ads.
**Route here from:** ai-creative-workflow when platform is specified.

---

## Why This Skill Exists

**The problem:** Every platform has different:
- Aspect ratios and safe zones
- Visual languages that perform
- Algorithm preferences
- User attention patterns
- Text overlay requirements

Generic "social media graphics" underperform because they ignore these differences.

**The solution:** Platform-specific knowledge built into prompt construction, so every graphic is optimized for where it will live.

## Model

**ALWAYS use Nano Banana Pro via Glif.**

| Model | Glif ID | Speed |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **🍌 Nano Banana Pro Text 2 Image** | `cmi7ne4p40000kz04yup2nxgh` | ~20sec |

**Exception:** For text-heavy graphics (quote cards, announcement graphics), route to ai-typography which uses Recraft v3 or Ideogram v3 for superior text rendering.

## Platform Specifications

### Instagram

| Placement | Ratio | Pixels | Safe Zone |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Feed (Square) | 1:1 | 1080×1080 | Full frame |
| Feed (Portrait) | 4:5 | 1080×1350 | Best engagement |
| Stories | 9:16 | 1080×1920 | Avoid top 250px, bottom 200px |
| Reels Cover | 9:16 | 1080×1920 | Center content |
| Carousel | 1:1 or 4:5 | 1080×1080/1350 | Consistent across slides |

**Instagram Visual Language:**

---

### YouTube

| Placement | Ratio | Pixels | Safe Zone |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|

| Channel Banner | 16:9 | 2560×1440 | Safe area: 1546×423 center |
| Community Post | 1:1 | 1080×1080 | Full frame |

**YouTube Thumbnail Formula:**
```
FACE + EMOTION + BRIGHT COLOR + CONTRAST + TEXT SPACE
```

Thumbnails compete against dozens of others. Survival requires:

- 3 or fewer colors, extremely bold
- Text readable at phone size

| Feed Image | 1:1 | 1080×1080 | Square option |
| Header | 3:1 | 1500×500 | Safe area centered |

**Twitter Visual Language:**

---

### TikTok

| Placement | Ratio | Pixels | Safe Zone |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Video Cover | 9:16 | 1080×1920 | Avoid bottom 150px (UI) |

## Style Exploration (Before Execution)

**Critical insight from ai-creative-strategist:** Don't lock into one style early. Generate multiple genuinely DIFFERENT visual directions first.

### Why This Matters for Social Graphics

Social graphics live in noisy feeds. The "right" style isn't obvious — it depends on:
- Platform visual language
- Audience expectations
- Competitive landscape
- Brand positioning

**One style = hope. Multiple styles = informed choice.**

### The Style Exploration Process

```
1. GENERATE 4-5 DIFFERENT STYLES
   → Not variations of one style
   → Genuinely different visual languages
   → Same subject, different aesthetic approaches

2. IDENTIFY WINNER
   → Which stops the scroll?
   → Which matches platform vibe?
   → Which feels most "brand"?

3. EXTRACT PRINCIPLES
   → What makes this style work?
   → Color palette?
   → Composition approach?
   → Lighting mood?

4. APPLY TO FORMATS
   → Same principles, different platforms
   → Build content SYSTEM
   → Repeatable, not one-off
```

### Style Exploration Prompt Template

For any new social graphics project, generate these 5 directions:

```
Style 1 - Clean Minimal:
[Subject] for [platform], clean minimal aesthetic, white space,
single focal point, modern typography space, sophisticated restraint

Style 2 - Bold Vibrant:
[Subject] for [platform], bold vibrant colors, high contrast,
dynamic composition, energetic attention-grabbing

Style 3 - Warm Lifestyle:
[Subject] for [platform], warm lifestyle aesthetic, natural tones,
authentic feeling, relatable human-centered

Style 4 - Dark & Premium:
[Subject] for [platform], dark moody aesthetic, premium feel,
sophisticated lighting, luxury positioning

Style 5 - Playful Creative:
[Subject] for [platform], playful creative aesthetic, unexpected angles,
personality-forward, memorable differentiation
```

### Style Decision Framework

After generating options:

| Question | Guides Toward |
|----------|---------------|
| Does brand feel established/premium? | Dark & Premium or Clean Minimal |
| Is brand approachable/friendly? | Warm Lifestyle or Playful Creative |
| Competing against boring competitors? | Bold Vibrant or Playful Creative |
| Professional B2B context? | Clean Minimal or Dark & Premium |
| Consumer/lifestyle product? | Warm Lifestyle or Bold Vibrant |

### Extract Principles Template

Once winner is identified, document:

```markdown
## Winning Style: [Name]

**What makes it work:**
- Color palette: [specific colors]
- Composition: [approach]
- Lighting: [mood/direction]
- Typography space: [how handled]
- Mood: [feeling it creates]

**Apply to other platforms:**
- Instagram Feed: [how to adapt]
- LinkedIn: [how to adapt]
- Twitter: [how to adapt]
- etc.
```

This creates a repeatable SYSTEM, not just one graphic.

---

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Platform Requirements

```
□ Which platform?
□ Which placement? (feed/stories/cover/etc.)
□ Aspect ratio confirmed?
□ Safe zones understood?
```

### Step 2: Content Type

```
□ What type of content? (announcement/quote/product/etc.)
□ Text overlay needed?
□ Brand colors required?
□ Specific elements must include?
```

### Step 3: Construct Platform-Optimized Prompt

Use templates above, customize for specific need.

### Step 4: Generate

```
Glif: 🍌 Nano Banana Pro Text 2 Image
ID: cmi7ne4p40000kz04yup2nxgh
Inputs: ["[platform-specific prompt]"]
```

### Step 5: Platform-Specific Review

Check against platform requirements:
- Correct ratio?
- Safe zones respected?
- Visual language matches platform?
- Scroll-stopping quality?
- Text space if needed?

### Step 6: Iterate or Approve

---

## Multi-Platform Scaling

When one concept needs multiple platforms:

### Strategy: Generate Primary, Then Adapt

```
1. Generate for PRIMARY platform (where it matters most)
2. Approve composition and style
3. Generate variants for other platforms
   - Adjust aspect ratio
   - Adjust composition for different safe zones
   - Maintain visual consistency
```

### Platform Adaptation Matrix

| From → To | Composition Change |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Instagram Feed → Stories | Recenter subject in middle third |
| YouTube Thumb → Twitter | Can often use as-is (both 16:9) |
| LinkedIn → Facebook | Minimal change (similar ratios) |
| Pinterest → Instagram | Square crop or reimagine |
| Any → Stories/TikTok | Full vertical recomposition needed |

### Batch Generation

```
For campaign "Product Launch":
├── Instagram Feed (4:5) - primary
├── Instagram Stories (9:16) - adapted
├── LinkedIn (1.91:1) - professional version
├── Twitter (16:9) - punchy version
└── Facebook (1.91:1) - broader appeal version
```

## Tips from Experience

### What Works
1. **Platform-first thinking** — Start with where it lives, not what it shows
2. **Ratio is non-negotiable** — Wrong ratio = wrong everything
3. **Safe zones matter** — Platform UI will cover content
4. **Visual language matching** — LinkedIn ≠ TikTok aesthetically
5. **Bold beats subtle** — Social is noisy, you need to pop

### What Doesn't Work
1. **One size fits all** — Generic "social media" prompts
2. **Ignoring platform culture** — Too polished for TikTok, too casual for LinkedIn
3. **Forgetting mobile** — Most viewing is phone-sized
4. **Text-heavy images** — Most platforms deprioritize
5. **Subtle visuals** — Get lost in the scroll

### The 80/20
80% of social graphic success comes from:
1. Correct aspect ratio
2. Platform-appropriate visual language
3. Scroll-stopping contrast/colors
4. Clear focal point

Get these four right and you'll outperform most content.
